# What's Cookin'? 🧑🏼‍🍳

Working on a Fullstack Web Application using a React frontend and Flask backend. <br>
Allows users to find recipes based on dietary needs and the ingredients they have.

Currently working on:
* Implement recipe search through input ingredients (make new tables for ingredients and a many-many table)
* Learning efficient Flask App Routing
* Learning the rules of React Development

Next up:
* User authentication/account sign-up and cookies
* Allowing users to save favorite recipes
* Research serverless hosting
* Maybe look into how GraphQL might be good to use?
